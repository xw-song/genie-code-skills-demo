# Genie Code Skills Demo

Example [Genie Code](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/genie-code/) skills, custom instructions, and MCP setup for enforcing enterprise data engineering standards across Databricks development.

## What is Genie Code?

[Genie Code](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/genie-code/) is Databricks' AI coding assistant. It can:

- **Author SDP pipelines** -- streaming tables, materialized views, CDC, medallion architecture
- **Develop notebooks** -- Python, SQL, Scala, R
- **Build DSML workflows** -- MLflow experiment tracking, model training, feature engineering
- **Create AI/BI dashboards** -- data visualizations and business intelligence
- **Develop Databricks Apps** -- full-stack applications on the lakehouse
- **Manage Unity Catalog** -- governance, permissions, lineage
- **Orchestrate jobs and workflows** -- scheduling, dependencies, monitoring

Genie Code supports **skills** (task-specific instructions following the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard) and **MCP** ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) connections that fetch enterprise standards from external sources like GitHub.

## How It Works

This demo shows three stages of Genie Code customization:

### 1. Baseline

Genie Code generates SDP pipeline code with no guidance. The output is functional but lacks naming conventions, audit columns, and PII handling.

### 2. Skills

Add `table-governance`, `sdp-basics`, and `pii-management` skills to your workspace. Genie Code now applies documentation standards, naming conventions, audit columns, TBLPROPERTIES, column descriptions, and PII annotations automatically.

### 3. MCP + Instructions

Connect a GitHub MCP server that points to the same skills in this repo. Add custom instructions that tell Genie Code to fetch and apply them dynamically. The result is automatic compliance with organizational policies, maintained centrally in version control.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A Databricks workspace with Genie Code enabled
- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html) installed and configured
- A GitHub account (for MCP setup)
- Python 3.9+ with `databricks-sdk` installed (for MCP deploy script)

### 1. Install Skills

Copy the skill files from `skills/data_eng/` to your Databricks workspace:

```
Workspace/
  .assistant/
    skills/
      table-governance.md
      sdp-basics.md
      pii-management.md
```

Skills can be installed at the workspace level (`Workspace/.assistant/skills/`) or user level (`/Users/{username}/.assistant/skills/`).

Once installed, Genie Code picks them up automatically. You can also invoke them explicitly with `@table-governance`, `@sdp-basics`, or `@pii-management`.

### 2. Set Up MCP (Optional)

Connect Genie Code to a GitHub MCP server to fetch the same skills dynamically -- no need to copy files into the workspace manually. The MCP connection points directly to the `skills/data_eng/` folder in this repo (or your fork of it).

**a. Configure**

```bash
cd mcp/
cp mcp_config.example.json mcp_config.json
# Edit mcp_config.json with your GitHub org, repo, and secret scope details
```

**b. Deploy**

```bash
pip install databricks-sdk
python deploy_mcp.py
```

The script will:
1. Create a Databricks secret scope and store your GitHub PAT
2. Print the SQL to create the MCP connection

**c. Create the connection**

Copy the printed SQL and run it in a Databricks SQL Editor.

### 3. Add Instructions

The `instructions/` folder contains **templates** with placeholders. To create ready-to-use instruction files for your workspace:

1. Set up your local deployment folder (see `local_deployment/README.md`)
2. Choose your approach (**direct skills** or **MCP**) and scope (**user-level** or **workspace-level**)
3. Copy the matching ready-to-use file from `local_deployment/instructions_to_use/`:

| Scope | Direct Skills | MCP |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| User-level | `user_instructions_skills.md` | `user_instructions_mcp.md` |
| Workspace-level | `workspace_instructions_skills.md` | `workspace_instructions_mcp.md` |

4. Fill in any remaining placeholders (GitHub org/repo for MCP files)
5. Upload to your workspace:
   - **User-level** → `/Users/{username}/.assistant_instructions.md`
   - **Workspace-level** → `Workspace/.assistant_workspace_instructions.md`

Workspace instructions take priority over user instructions when both are present.

## Try It Yourself -- Sample Data

Generate synthetic financial data to test the skills end-to-end. The data generation notebook uses [`dbldatagen`](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen) (Databricks Labs Data Generator) for Spark-native synthetic data generation.

### Option A: Deploy with DAB (Recommended)

Set up a local deployment folder with your workspace-specific config:

```bash
# See local_deployment/README.md for full setup instructions and examples
# Create databricks.yml at the repo root and resource configs in local_deployment/resources/

# Deploy and run from the repo root
databricks bundle deploy --profile <your-cli-profile>
databricks bundle run generate_financial_data --profile <your-cli-profile>
```

### Option B: Run Interactively

Upload the notebook to your workspace manually and run it interactively -- set the `catalog`, `schema`, and `volume` widget values when prompted.

### Build a Pipeline

With the sample data in your volume, use Genie Code:

> "Create an SDP pipeline that reads the financial CSV files from `/Volumes/{catalog}/{schema}/raw_data/` and builds a bronze-silver-gold medallion architecture."

Genie Code will apply the skills and standards automatically.

### Run the Demo

For a guided walkthrough that progressively adds skills, instructions, and MCP, see [`docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md). It includes specific prompts, setup/cleanup steps for each stage, and observation checklists showing what to look for.

## Try It Yourself -- Bakehouse Sentiment Analysis

Stage 5 of the demo applies the new `@sentiment-analysis` skill to the **AI/BI Bakehouse** dataset from the Databricks Marketplace. The flow is:

1. Install the Marketplace share into a scratch catalog and mirror selected tables into a new schema inside your existing demo catalog. This keeps the demo data under one predictable namespace (`<demo_catalog>.bakehouse.*`).
2. Use Genie Code with `@sentiment-analysis` to generate bronze/silver/gold tables that turn `<demo_catalog>.bakehouse.customer_reviews` into a sentiment dataset using AI functions (`ai_analyze_sentiment`, `ai_classify`, `ai_extract`).

### 1. Install the Bakehouse share + mirror into the demo catalog

Copy the config template and fill in your workspace details:

```bash
cp marketplace_data/bakehouse_config.example.yaml local_deployment/bakehouse_config.yaml
# Edit local_deployment/bakehouse_config.yaml:
#   workspace_host, profile,
#   scratch_catalog_name  (where the share lands -- pick a unique per-user name),
#   demo_catalog          (your existing demo catalog),
#   demo_schema           (default: bakehouse)
```

Then either deploy via DAB:

```bash
databricks bundle deploy --profile <your-cli-profile>
databricks bundle run install_bakehouse --profile <your-cli-profile>
```

…or run the standalone script:

```bash
./marketplace_data/deploy.sh --run
```

The notebook is idempotent: it skips the Marketplace install when `scratch_catalog_name` already exists, and uses `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` for the mirror so re-runs are safe.

### 2. Generate the pipeline with Genie Code

In a Genie Code session with the skills available (workspace-uploaded or via MCP):

> Build a bronze, silver, and gold pipeline from `<demo_catalog>.bakehouse.customer_reviews`. Add sentiment, topic, and extracted entities on silver using AI functions, then aggregate sentiment by franchise on gold. Apply `@table-governance`, `@sdp-basics`, `@pii-management`, and `@sentiment-analysis`.

The result is a governed sentiment-analysis pipeline that follows every project standard: layer prefixes, audit columns, AI cost guardrails, sentiment label constraints, and PII annotations on the raw `review_text`.
